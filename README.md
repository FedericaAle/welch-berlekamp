Berlekamp welch algorithm demo for CS70
===============
The demo is in `Berlekamp Welch Demo.ipynb`. The demo is pretty self-contained and doesn't rely heavily on 3rd party packages. This means that it should run pretty smoothly on any python version. (The versions that I've tested and worked including 2.7.10, 2.7.7, 3.4.3).</br></br>
To run the demo, be sure to have ipython and notebook installed (if you don't, the <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/sp16/installation.html">script</a> from EE16A should take care of it for you, but also install a bunch of extra packages). Then, simply navigate to the folder in terminal, and type:

```
ipython notebook
```
Select Berlekamp Welch Demo.ipynb in the web interface popped up, and you should be good to go!


Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/j2kun/welch-berlekamp">Jeremy Kun</a> for the original idea and the codebase that supports arithmetic under finite field!
